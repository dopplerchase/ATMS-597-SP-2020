# ATMS 597 SN Weather and Climate Data Science
## Project 2: Pandas - Use for reducing data (version 1.0)
### Due: 13 February at midnight to Learn@Illinois

You will work in groups of 3 to complete this assignment, which are assigned on Learn@Illinois.  Students who are not taking the course for credit may join to form their own groups, however their assignment will not be graded.

Task:
Create code using python `pandas` to organize and reduce climate data.

Functionality Requirements:
* The code must be object-oriented (i.e. be method-based), and may or may not require keywords.
	i.e.,  `tempconvert.dosomething(input)`
* The code must work on lists and numpy arrays as input, and return the same numerical type.
* You can develop the code using Colab Notebooks, or any other way, but the repository should be submitted to GitHub as a python script (i.e., .py, not a notebook!), and include a descriptive README.md.

Formatting and Documentation Requirements:
* The code must contain docstrings and comments where appropriate.
* The code must be formatted in PEP8.

GitHub usage requirements:
* The code must be originally forked from the repository [swnesbitt/ATMS-597-SP-2020](https://github.com/swnesbitt/ATMS-597-SP-2020/) by a group member.
* The code must be submitted as a link to a GitHub repository in Learn@Illinois by the end of the day on the due date.  
* Each project member must have contributed to the code at least once either through branching or through forking, making a commit, with acceptance of a pull request.

Reflection:
* Each individual group member is required to submit a reflection, which can be between 100-250 words. This reflection should contain their experience in developing the homework, a discussion of challenges and how they were overcome (or not), suggestions for improving the exercise, and any issues with partners.  This reflection is submitted in the Project 1 - Reflection assignment on Learn@Illinois.
