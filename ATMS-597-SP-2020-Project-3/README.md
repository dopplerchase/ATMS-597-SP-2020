# Welcome to Project 3
Group Members: Randy Chase, Bowen Fang and Itinderjot Singh

Here we are looking into using xarray and considering daily precipitaion observations (https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/data/gridded/data.gpcp.html) from around the world. Our group was tasked with looking at Champaign, IL. 

We will consider the mean environment on the days where we have precipitation greater than the 95th percentile (top 5% of raining days). To consider the environment we will use NCEP reanalysis data (https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/data/gridded/data.ncep.reanalysis.html)
