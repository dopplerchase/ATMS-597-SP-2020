Welcome to Project 2 for ATMS-597-SP-2020

The task for the repository was to create a class to be able to grab data from the NOAA and create the "Climate Stripes" for the data collected. Specifically, the groupmates were to gain experience with using an API, [Pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas) and [Matplotlib](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib). As an example of how to use the class see the notebook labeled [example.ipynb](https://github.com/dopplerchase/ATMS-597-SP-2020/blob/master/ATMS-597-SP-2020-Project-2/example.ipynb)

The main data source can be found [here](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/webservices/v2).
The original author of the "Climate Stripes" idea is [Ed Hawkins from the University of Redding, UK](https://showyourstripes.info/).
